# Loan-Prediction-scikit-learn

## Project designed in Hirachical Learning Method

- Start with basic, machine learning using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithms.
- Enhance Machine Learning Accuracy by doing some parameter optimization. Enhance Accuracy by adding the Feature Enginnering
  to the Machine Learning mix.
- Use the Data Augmentation to enhance our accuracy to even little more higher.
- Save all of our work as a model to disk and reload the model from the disk to perform another prediction using the test
  dataset.
